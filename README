# noc

NoC - Translation of 'Nature of Code' examples from shiffman.net into
clojure using the incanter processing library from incanter.org.

## Usage

For now, its best to start swank, connect to it with emacs and run
individual examples using emacs:

    1. start emacs
    2. start an eshell in emacs, cd to noc directory
    3. at the shell prompt: 
       lein swank
    4. in emacs M-x slime-connect
    5. open an example file, C-c C-k to run it


## Installation

Requires leiningen (and emacs+swank-clojure.) After that, clone the
git repo, then follow usage instructions.
